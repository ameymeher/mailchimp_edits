    <h2>Workshop Reminder</h2>
    <p>Hello All,</p>
    <p>We are just a few days before the Workshop. Check-in will start at 8:30 am both days, with presentations starting at 9 am both days. Please check the schedule on our <a href="your_website_link_here" style="color: #3498db; text-decoration: underline;">Website</a> for the order of speakers and details.</p>

    <p>Please find attached a document containing a Directional Map for locating Parking at our Venue and also Additional Eatery information for Hillsborough Street and Campus.</p>

    <p>SAS Hall is on NC State's Main Campus which can be found between Western Blvd and Hillsborough Street in Raleigh, NC. Your favorite Map Apps should help you find your way onto campus, and the attached map will provide extra details to our Venue:</p>
    <address>
      SAS Hall<br>
      2311 Stinson Dr.<br>
      Raleigh, NC 27607
    </address>

    <p>Additional Eatery Information has a link to close by Campus and Hillsborough Street restaurants.</p>

    <p>As mentioned in earlier correspondence, Clark Dining Hall has agreed to have an all-you-can-eat Dining Hall option available to our attendees for about $11.95. We are dividing our attendee list into groups so as to reduce the waiting online with everyone showing up at once.</p>

    <p>So if this is the lunch option that you're most interested in - PLEASE Note the Number at the start of your Subject Line (1) for this email - you'll head out at the start of the lunch break with Bojko Bakalov, one of our Hosts, leading the way... The 2nd and 3rd other groups will follow after 10 -15 minutes with another Workshop Host leading their group down the sidewalk to the dining hall.</p>

    <p>We'll repeat a similar routine, (maybe reversing our order) on Sunday for lunch.</p>

    <p>There will be information shared between presentations regarding the No Host Social and its location on Saturday Evening.</p>

    <p style="color: #333;">We are looking forward to having everyone join us for the Workshop and hope that everyone has a great time here on NC State's Main Campus!</p>

    <p style="color: #3498db;">Best,<br> Mary Catherine</p>
